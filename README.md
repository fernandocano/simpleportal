# Portal

This app was generated with the [ampersand cli tool](http://ampersandjs.com/learn/quick-start-guide).

## Modifications
1. Replaced jade with pug 2.x and using puglatizer
1. Upgraded bootstrap

This is a simple portal with links to more complex applications.  The back ends
are separate projects that provide distinct restful apis.  Final deployments into a webserver to deliver the client apps remove the need for express and fake apis that are in this project for development and testing.


## How to run it

1. download/install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
1. install dependencies: `npm install`
1. run it: `npm start`
1. open http://localhost:3000 in a browser
